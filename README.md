# news_scraping

I ran into this idea while learning about data scraping. Would not it be nice to have a simple application that gives us a list of all
the most recent top news headlines directly from one of your favourite news websites?

With the same idea I just created a simple script to do the task, which is not convenient for an average user. The average reader would
need a gui.
